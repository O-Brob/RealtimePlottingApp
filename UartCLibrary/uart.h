/**********************************************************************************************************************
 * (Made as a part of a Chalmers graduation project)
 *
 * This header file defines the interface for the UART library to send timestamped data.
 * It is made to be compatible with the following application, which can visualize
 * the transmitted data through plotting: https://github.com/O-Brob/RealtimePlottingApp
 *
 * The following allows for the initialization, data transmission, and timestamping
 * of data packets over the peripheral on an STM32F4 microcontroller.
 *
 * The following functionality is provided:
 * - Initialization of USART peripherals for asynchronous communication.
 * - Storage of timestamped data packets to be transmitted over UART.
 * - Flushing of stored data either one packet at a time or all at once.
 *
 * Supports flexible payload sizes to be set during initialization (8, 16, or 32 bits), and
 * can operate with a timestamp that is periodically incremented by a timer interrupt.
 *
 * The UART communication is set up to transmit data in a circular buffer.
 * It only starts transmitting over TX after receiving an 'S' byte in the Read Data Register,
 * and stops + resets the internal buffer on receiving an 'R' byte.
 *
 * Notes:
 * - No alignment byte is sent between packages, and as such, data should not be stored
 *   in different orders (as indicated by the pointer array) on sequential stores,
 *   and preferably not be done in multiple separate interrupt handlers at once.
 *
 * - When a payload size is set (16 bits, for example), every variable stored is expected to
 *   be at the set size or lower.
 *
 * - The timestamp is assumed to be provided by an external timer interrupt
 *   and is used to timestamp data packets before transmission.
